/**
 * Resolves the customer's selected pickup location for the active sales-channel
 * context and validates that it still belongs to the current sales channel.
 *
 * The selection is read from {@see PickupContextStorage} (the persisted context
 * payload) rather than a request-local context extension. That extension is only
 * attached on context *resolution* and reflects the payload as it was at the
 * start of the request; during the very request that persists a new selection —
 * or on a cloned/restored context that never passed the resolver listener — it is
 * stale or absent. Reading the persisted store makes resolution deterministic on
 * every cart-calculation pass, so a valid selection can never intermittently
 * disappear between recalculations.
