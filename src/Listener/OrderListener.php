/**
 * On order placement for a pickup order, persists the order pickup-location
 * record (location + chosen time + instructions — the single source of truth),
 * dispatches the {@see PickupOrderPlacedEvent} flow trigger, and clears the
 * pickup selection from the context so the next cart starts clean. Notifications
 * are handled by Flow Builder flows reacting to the trigger — no mail here.
 *
 * Loading pickup data onto an order is handled by the DAL OneToOne association
 * (`order.kommandhubPickupLocation`), so no order-loaded listener is needed.
