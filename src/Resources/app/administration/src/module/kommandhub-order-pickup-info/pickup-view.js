/**
 * Derives the read-only view state for the order Pickup Information tab from a
 * `kommandhub_order_pickup_location` record. Pure (no Shopware globals) so the
 * missing/deleted-location rule can be unit-tested in isolation.
 *
 * States:
 * - `empty`            — the order has no pickup record (not a pickup order).
 * - `located`          — the pickup location still exists and is loaded.
 * - `location-deleted` — the location was deleted (FK set null); the historical
 *                        appointment data (pickup time + comment) is still kept.
 *
 * @param {object|null|undefined} record
 * @returns {{state: string, location: object|null, pickupTime: *, comment: *, createdAt: *}}
